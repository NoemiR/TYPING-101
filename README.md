Description

This is a typing game. It gives you random words to type. It allows you to type ten words each round in 60 seconds.  It has backgound music to relax you while playing. The game ends only if you get three words wrong. When the game ends there is an explosion and a modal pops up with a "Game Over" message and gives you the option to restart.

Challenge
 Creating this game was challenging but fun. The most difficult thing was adding the restart button and putting the restart function. I was able to fix it.
 
 Future
